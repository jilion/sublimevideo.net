We liked that it looks the same with Flash or HTML5 video (that was important to our customer; they didn’t want to know about different video types, etc; they just didn’t want the look to change at any time), and (most importantly) that it was super-easy to implement. The ease-of-implementation saved us a lot of time.”"

        %p= "This means we have high standards, but not that we want to reinvent the wheel: there is such a thing as building on the shoulders of giants. To us, SublimeVideo is one such giant: it puts great engineering at the service of original design. Practically speaking, it enables us to integrate rock-solid video capabilities into our sites and applications, safe in the knowledge they will work everywhere, so we can focus on what the video is about and what happens around it."
        %p= "Because Jilion keeps an eye on the rapidly changing browser and plug-in landscape, we know our videos will keep playing, no matter what. That kind of surveillance is best centralised and entrusted to a specialist. The application’s low-latency, high-availability platform is second to none and we know integrating SublimeVideo in our sites will not penalise end users by slowing down pages. SublimeVideo shares our commitments and blends into our code: what more could we ask for?”"
