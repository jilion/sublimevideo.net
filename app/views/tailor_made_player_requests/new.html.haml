            A Tailor-made player with a full custom design and branding based on the
            = link_to 'existing features and add-ons', page_path('modular-player')
            of SublimeVideo is completely possible today. See the
            = link_to 'Tailor-Made Players', page_path('tailor-made-players')
            page for some examples of such branded tailor-made players.

            = link_to 'upcoming functionalities already pre-announced', page_path('modular-player', anchor: 'upcoming_features')
            , can also be considered, but with possible time constraints.
          %li A Tailor-made based on completely new add-ons or "exotic" features is probably not immediately possible, unless you come to us with convincing arguments so we accept to derive from our planned roadmap. The good news is that we are working on a solution, read on:

        Implementing your Tailor-Made Player(s) ourselves is a temporary solution we propose today. Our goal is to

          = link_to 'bring this capability to any designer or developer', page_path('horizon-framework', anchor: 'opening-horizon-to-developers')
        in a convenient and scalable way as soon as possible. You will be notified of our progress in that domain in due time.
