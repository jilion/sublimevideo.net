1
00:00:03.373 --> 00:00:06.389
SublimeVideo is the most compatible and reliable

2
00:00:06.389 --> 00:00:08.776
HTML5 Video Player

3
00:00:08.776 --> 00:00:10.900
It works really well because SublimeVideo is

4
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.393
a Cloud Service that requires no maintenance

5
00:00:14.393 --> 00:00:16.714
Each month, it delivers tens of millions

6
00:00:16.714 --> 00:00:19.676
of players to thousands of sites

7
00:00:19.768 --> 00:00:22.780
But we want to go beyond our standard Cloud player

8
00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:25.144
We want to provide the technology that will allow

9
00:00:25.144 --> 00:00:28.192
the creation of any player you can imagine

10
00:00:28.192 --> 00:00:31.025
Wouldn't it be great to have full design freedom?

11
00:00:31.025 --> 00:00:35.008
...in order to get your player, expressing your identity

12
00:00:35.008 --> 00:00:37.588
with the utmost care for every detail

13
00:00:37.588 --> 00:00:41.712
Wouldn’t it be great to have total flexibility and modularity?

14
00:00:41.712 --> 00:00:43.328
...so you could build Your player

15
00:00:43.328 --> 00:00:46.248
with exactly the features you need

16
00:00:46.248 --> 00:00:49.584
For instance, a band could display a “Buy Song” button

17
00:00:49.584 --> 00:00:50.969
to sell its music

18
00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.424
A car company could integrate a 360 degree viewer

19
00:00:54.424 --> 00:00:56.064
right into the player

20
00:00:56.064 --> 00:00:58.312
Or an e-commerce site could integrate

21
00:00:58.312 --> 00:01:00.904
instant stock information

22
00:01:00.904 --> 00:01:03.064
Above all, wouldn’t it be amazing

23
00:01:03.064 --> 00:01:05.808
if this tailor-made design and functionality

24
00:01:05.808 --> 00:01:08.520
would work perfectly on any browser

25
00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.478
from the iPad down to IE6?

26
00:01:12.371 --> 00:01:14.858
Well, now, all of this is possible!

27
00:01:14.858 --> 00:01:16.760
We are extremely proud to introduce

28
00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:21.797
the World’s first HTML5-Video, Application Framework

29
00:01:21.797 --> 00:01:24.733
It’s called SublimeVideo Framework

30
00:01:24.733 --> 00:01:28.736
SublimeVideo Framework offers total creative freedom

31
00:01:28.736 --> 00:01:33.368
that just works... pixel-perfect, on any platform

32
00:01:33.368 --> 00:01:38.226
SublimeVideo Framework actually draws interfaces using powerful vector graphics

33
00:01:38.226 --> 00:01:40.264
It can, for the first time

34
00:01:40.264 --> 00:01:43.248
produce the most sophisticated player designs

35
00:01:43.248 --> 00:01:47.552
like for instance this HTML5 branded player

36
00:01:47.552 --> 00:01:50.152
With SublimeVideo Framework’s vector graphics technology

37
00:01:50.152 --> 00:01:53.928
this player works and looks perfect on any platform

38
00:01:53.928 --> 00:01:58.565
particularly on the finest screens, like Retina displays

39
00:01:58.565 --> 00:02:02.568
Thanks to SublimeVideo Framework, your player embodies your branding

40
00:02:02.568 --> 00:02:06.020
colors, shapes and even fonts

41
00:02:06.728 --> 00:02:10.168
Its design perfection, along with its interactive features

42
00:02:10.168 --> 00:02:13.136
can be embedded, with no degradation

43
00:02:13.136 --> 00:02:15.736
into any web site or blog

44
00:02:15.736 --> 00:02:19.872
becoming an eye-catching ambassador for your brand

45
00:02:19.872 --> 00:02:21.976
SublimeVideo Framework is fully modular

46
00:02:21.976 --> 00:02:24.456
Web Publishers can now build their own Player

47
00:02:24.456 --> 00:02:26.744
with add-ons and options

48
00:02:28.128 --> 00:02:32.088
Plus, SublimeVideo Framework fully integrates with YouTube!

49
00:02:32.088 --> 00:02:33.936
Now you can use them together!

50
00:02:33.936 --> 00:02:35.712
YouTube to host your videos

51
00:02:35.712 --> 00:02:39.560
and SublimeVideo as your ultimate branded Player!

52
00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.144
And it also works with Vimeo Pro

53
00:02:42.144 --> 00:02:44.766
or your own hosting solution if you prefer

54
00:02:44.766 --> 00:02:49.272
SublimeVideo Framework gives you more freedom than ever to host your videos

55
00:02:49.272 --> 00:02:53.593
Today we’re rolling out a New Modular SublimeVideo Player service

56
00:02:53.593 --> 00:02:56.760
for everyone, with its own add-ons store

57
00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.816
At the same time, we’re opening a partnership program

58
00:02:59.816 --> 00:03:04.128
with web agencies, creative studios and IT firms

59
00:03:04.128 --> 00:03:06.192
which will enable them to provide their customers

60
00:03:06.192 --> 00:03:09.040
with tailor-made video players

61
00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.696
It’s also our goal to make SublimeVideo Framework’s

62
00:03:11.696 --> 00:03:14.544
technology available to other partners

63
00:03:14.544 --> 00:03:18.902
like Internet platforms, CMSs and OVPs

64
00:03:19.133 --> 00:03:23.992
With SublimeVideo Framework, we really want to build the best technology foundation possible

65
00:03:23.992 --> 00:03:28.344
in order to truly enable the HTML5 Video Age

66
00:03:28.344 --> 00:03:30.179
