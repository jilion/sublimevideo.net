1
00:00:03.373 --> 00:00:06.389
SublimeVideo is the most compatible and reliable

2
00:00:06.389 --> 00:00:08.776
HTML5 Video Player

3
00:00:08.776 --> 00:00:10.900
It works really well because SublimeVideo is

4
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.393
a Cloud Service that requires no maintenance

5
00:00:14.393 --> 00:00:16.714
Each month, it delivers tens of millions

6
00:00:16.714 --> 00:00:19.676
of players to thousands of sites

7
00:00:19.768 --> 00:00:22.780
But we want to go beyond our standard Cloud player

8
00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:25.144
We want to provide the technology that will allow

9
00:00:25.144 --> 00:00:28.192
the creation of any player you can imagine

10
00:00:28.192 --> 00:00:31.025
Wouldn't it be great to have full design freedom?

11
00:00:31.025 --> 00:00:35.008
...in order to get your player, expressing your identity

12
00:00:35.008 --> 00:00:37.588
with the utmost care for every detail

13
00:00:37.588 --> 00:00:41.712
Wouldn’t it be great to have total flexibility and modularity?

14
00:00:41.712 --> 00:00:43.328
...so you could build Your player

15
00:00:43.328 --> 00:00:46.248
with exactly the features you need

16
00:00:46.248 --> 00:00:49.584
For instance, a band could display a “Buy Song” button

17
00:00:49.584 --> 00:00:50.969
to sell its music

18
00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.424
A car company could integrate a 360 degree viewer

19
00:00:54.424 --> 00:00:56.064
right into the player

20
00:00:56.064 --> 00:00:58.312
Or an e-commerce site could integrate

21
00:00:58.312 --> 00:01:00.904
instant stock information

22
00:01:00.904 --> 00:01:03.064
Above all, wouldn’t it be amazing

23
00:01:03.064 --> 00:01:05.808
if this tailor-made design and functionality

24
00:01:05.808 --> 00:01:08.520
would work perfectly on any browser

25
00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.478
from the iPad down to IE6?

26
00:01:12.371 --> 00:01:14.858
Well, now, all of this is possible!

27
00:01:14.858 --> 00:01:16.760
We are extremely proud to introduce

28
00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:21.797
the World’s first HTML5-Video, Application Framework

29
00:01:21.797 --> 00:01:24.733
the SublimeVideo Framework

30
00:01:24.733 --> 00:01:28.736
SublimeVideo Framework offers total creative freedom

31
00:01:28.736 --> 00:01:33.368
that just works... pixel-perfect, on any platform

32
00:01:33.368 --> 00:01:38.226
the Framework actually draws interfaces using powerful vector graphics

33
00:01:38.226 --> 00:01:40.264
It can, for the first time

34
00:01:40.264 --> 00:01:43.248
produce the most sophisticated player designs

35
00:01:43.248 --> 00:01:47.552
like for instance this HTML5 branded player

36
00:01:47.552 --> 00:01:50.152
With SublimeVideo vector graphics technology

37
00:01:50.152 --> 00:01:53.928
this player works and looks perfect on any platform

38
00:01:53.928 --> 00:01:58.565
particularly on the finest screens, like Retina displays

39
00:01:58.565 --> 00:02:02.568

into any web site or blog

becoming an eye-catching ambassador for your brand

45
00:02:19.872 --> 00:02:21.976
SublimeVideo is fully modular

46
00:02:21.976 --> 00:02:24.456
Web Publishers can now build their own Player

47
00:02:24.456 --> 00:02:26.744
with add-ons and options

48
00:02:28.128 --> 00:02:32.088
